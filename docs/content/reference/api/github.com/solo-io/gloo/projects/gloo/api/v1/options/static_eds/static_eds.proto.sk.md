### UpstreamSpec

 
Static eds upstreams are identical to static upstreams except that the clusters will receive their
 configuration via EDS.

Similar to static upstreams, static eds upstreams:
 - are used to route request to services listening at fixed IP/Host & Port pairs.
 - can be used to proxy any kind of service, and therefore contain a ServiceSpec for additional service-specific configuration.
 - must be created manually by users

```yaml
"localityEndpoints": []static_eds.options.gloo.solo.io.LocalityLbEndpoints
"useTls": bool
"serviceSpec": .options.gloo.solo.io.ServiceSpec
"autoSniRewrite": .google.protobuf.BoolValue

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 
| `localityEndpoints` | [[]static_eds.options.gloo.solo.io.LocalityLbEndpoints](../static_eds.proto.sk/#localitylbendpoints) | A list of addresses and ports, separated by locality at least one must be specified. |
| `useTls` | `bool` | Attempt to use outbound TLS Gloo will automatically set this to true for port 443. |
| `serviceSpec` | [.options.gloo.solo.io.ServiceSpec](../../service_spec.proto.sk/#servicespec) | An optional Service Spec describing the service listening at this address. |
| `autoSniRewrite` | [.google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value) | When set, automatically set the sni address to use to the addr field. If both this and host.sni_addr are set, host.sni_addr has priority. defaults to "true". |




---
### LocalityLbEndpoints

 
A group of endpoints belonging to a Locality.

```yaml
"locality": .static_eds.options.gloo.solo.io.Locality
"lbEndpoints": []static_eds.options.gloo.solo.io.LbEndpoint
"loadBalancingWeight": .google.protobuf.UInt32Value

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 
| `locality` | [.static_eds.options.gloo.solo.io.Locality](../static_eds.proto.sk/#locality) | Identifies where the hosts run. |
| `lbEndpoints` | [[]static_eds.options.gloo.solo.io.LbEndpoint](../static_eds.proto.sk/#lbendpoint) | The group of endpoints belonging to the locality specified. |
| `loadBalancingWeight` | [.google.protobuf.UInt32Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/u-int-32-value) | Optional: Per priority/region/zone/sub_zone weight; at least 1. The load balancing weight for a locality is divided by the sum of the weights of all localities at the same priority level to produce the effective percentage of traffic for the locality. |




---
### LbEndpoint

 
An Endpoint that Envoy can route traffic to.

```yaml
"addr": string
"port": int
"sniAddr": string
"healthCheckConfig": .static_eds.options.gloo.solo.io.LbEndpoint.HealthCheckConfig

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 
| `addr` | `string` | Address (hostname or IP). |
| `port` | `int` | Port the instance is listening on. |
| `sniAddr` | `string` | Address to use for SNI if using ssl. |
| `healthCheckConfig` | [.static_eds.options.gloo.solo.io.LbEndpoint.HealthCheckConfig](../static_eds.proto.sk/#healthcheckconfig) | (Enterprise Only): Host specific health checking configuration. |




---
### HealthCheckConfig



```yaml
"path": string

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 
| `path` | `string` | (Enterprise Only): Path to use when health checking this specific host. |




---
### Locality

 
Identifies location of where either Envoy runs or where upstream hosts run.

```yaml
"region": string
"zone": string
"subZone": string

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 
| `region` | `string` | Region this zone belongs to. |
| `zone` | `string` | Defines the local service zone where Envoy is running. The meaning of zone is context dependent, e.g. `Availability Zone (AZ) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html>`_ on AWS, `Zone <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/>`_ on GCP, etc. |
| `subZone` | `string` | When used for locality of upstream hosts, this field further splits zone into smaller chunks of sub-zones so they can be load balanced independently. |
